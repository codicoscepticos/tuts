It would be right to use uppercase for `birthday`, because we know from before
the value of that. According to that common practice mentioned in the article,
`age` is okay to remain in lowercase as it is a value that we do not know from
before. Also, the name of the const `age` is such that it can also be used as a
variable instead of a constant, because is a generic name which could refer to
any value of age. In both of these cases, I believe no matter if we know the
value of a constant beforehand or not, it's best to name all of them in
uppercase (once it is decided to name some constants in uppercase, then it's
actually better to name all of them in uppercase, for better homogeneity.)
